            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <img src="images/jobabout.jpg" alt="Afrilink Agency Team" loading="lazy" style="width:100%; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom:2rem;">
            <p>Founded in 2020 amid the global challenges of the pandemic, Afrilink Agency was born from a simple yet powerful vision: to bridge the gap between talented Kenyans and international job opportunities. Our founder, a Kenyan entrepreneur with firsthand experience in overseas work, saw the untapped potential in our youth and skilled workers who dreamed of building better lives abroad but faced barriers like complex visas, mismatched skills, and lack of connections.</p>
            <p>Starting small in Nairobi, we began by assisting a handful of clients with resume tweaks and job leads in the Middle East. Today, we've grown into a trusted agency that's placed over 500 individuals in roles across Canada, the UK, Dubai, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Our work isn't just about jobsâ€”it's about transformation. We've helped families escape poverty, funded educations back home, and created success stories that inspire entire communities.</p>
            <p>What sets us apart? Personalized guidance from start to finish, from training to placement. We're committed to ethical recruitment, ensuring fair wages and safe environments. As we look to the future, our mission remains: Unlocking doors for every Kenyan ready to step into a brighter tomorrow.</p>
